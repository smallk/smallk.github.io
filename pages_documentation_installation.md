<h1 id="vagrant"> Quickstart: Vagrant Virtual Machine </h1>

Installing SmallK into a virtual machine (OSX, Linux, Windows) is intended for those who are not doing development and/or do not have a reason to do the full installation on Linux or OSX outlined in sections III.2 to III.4 (Windows full installation coming soon).

The complete stack of software dependencies for SmallK as well as SmallK itself can be rapidly set up and configured through use of Vagrant and VirtualBox and the files included in the repository. To deploy the SmallK VM:
The Vagrant install has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 14.04, Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10.5, and Windows 8.

**1.** Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

**2.** ’git clone’ the [smallk_data](https://github.com/smallk/smallk_data) repository so that it is parallel with the smallk repository. This will be important for testing the installation and starting to work with SmallK. This directory will be synced with a directory of the same name in the VM.

_[Note: For Windows, ensure that you have a VirtualBox version >= 4.3.12. After installing Vagrant, you may need to log out and log back in to ensure that you can run vagrant commands in the command prompt.]_

**3..** From within the vagrant/ directory in the repository, run:
		
		vagrant up
		
This can take as long as an hour to build the VM, which will be based on a minimal Ubuntu 14.04 installation. The Vagrantfile can be customized in many ways to change the specifications for the VM that is built. See more information [here](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/). The default configuration provides the VM with 4 GB of memory and 2 CPUs. Increasing these allocations will improve the performance of the application. This can be done by modifying this line in the Vagrantfile:

		vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "4056", "--cpus", "2"]

After ‘vagrant up’ has completed, the SmallK library will have been built and the smallk_data directory, cloned as in **2.** above, will have been synced into the VM.
<br>[--back to top--](#top)

**4..** Once the VM has been built, run:

		vagrant ssh

_[Note: For Windows, you will need an ssh client in order to run the above command. This can be obtained via [CygWin](https://www.cygwin.com/), [MinGW](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/), or [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads). If you would like to use PuTTY to connect to your virtual machine, follow [these](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/wiki/Connect-to-Your-Vagrant-Virtual-Machine-with-PuTTY) instructions.]_

This will drop you into the command line of the VM that was just created. Note that the *bootstrap.sh* file can be modified to perform various tasks when going to the vagrant command line session. Customize bootstrap.sh to set up a custom install of libsmallk as required.

From there, you can navigate to /home/vagrant/libsmallk-<version>, e.g., libsmallk-1.6.0, and run

		make check DATA_DIR=../smallk_data
		
make check will verify your installation was successful. 

To check the installation of pysmallk, run

		make pysmallk_check DATA_DIR=../smallk_data

In case you need it, the username/password for the VM created will be vagrant/vagrant.

The command

		sudo make install

will install smallk to the /usr/local/smallk/bin directory. If you want to install pysmallk as well, run

		sudo make install PYSMALLK=1 INSTALLATION_DIR=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

To add smallk to your PATH variable: 

		export PATH=/usr/local/smallk/bin:$PATH
		
[--back to top--](#top)

**5.** To test the installation at the command line, assuming the $PATH variable has been set as above, run

		nmf

This will produce the help out put for the nmf library function:

	Usage: nmf
        --matrixfile <filename>  Filename of the matrix to be factored.
                                 Either CSV format for dense or MatrixMarket format for sparse.

                                 If unspecified, H will be randomly initialized. 
        [--outfile_W  w.csv]     Filename for the W matrix result.
        [--outfile_H  h.csv]     Filename for the H matrix result.

                                     1 == print updates, 0 == silent 

**6.** To test the installation of pysmallk, open a python terminal and import numpy and pysmallk. Numpy must be imported BEFORE pysmallk is imported.

		python
		import numpy
		import pysmallk
		
If there is no import error, pysmallk was installed correctly and is globally available.
		

**7.** When you are ready to shut down the VM, run one of the following.

Save the current running state:

		vagrant suspend

Gracefully shut down the machine:

		vagrant halt

Remove the VM from your machine (this will require rebuilding the VM to restart it)

		vagrant destroy

If you want to work with the VM again, from any of the above states you can run

		vagrant up
		
again and the VM will be resumed or recreated.

<h1 id="standard"> Standard Build Instructions </h1>

<h2 id="pre"> Prerequisites </h2>
* A modern C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard, such as the latest release of the GNU or clang compilers
* [Elemental](http://libelemental.org/), a high-performance library for dense, distributed linear algebra, 
which requires:
	* An MPI installation, such as [OpenMPI](http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.6/)
	* A BLAS implementation, preferably optimized/tuned for the local system
	* [libFLAME](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~flame/web/libFLAME.html): a high-performance library for dense linear algebra
	* [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/): (optional)
	* CMake 
* Python 2.7, including the following libraries: 
	* numpy
	* scipy
	* cython

Elemental can make use of OpenMP parallelization if available. This is generally advantageous for large problems. The SmallK code is also internally parallelized to take full advantage of multiple CPU cores for maximum performance.  SmallK does not currently support distributed computation. However, future updates are planned that provide this capability.

We **strongly** recommend that users install both the HybridRelease and PureRelease builds of [Elemental](http://libelemental.org/). OpenMP is enabled in the HybridRelease build and disabled in the PureRelease build.  So why install both?  For smaller problems the overhead of *OpenMP can actually cause code to run slower* than without it.  Whereas for large problems OpenMP parallelization generally helps, but there is no clear transition point between where it helps and where it hurts.  Thus we encourage users to experiment with both builds to find the one that performs best for their typical problems.

We also recommend that users clearly separate the different build types as well as the versions of Elemental on their systems.  Elemental is under active development, and new releases can introduce changes to the API that are not backwards-compatible with previous releases.  To minimize build problems and overall hassle, we recommend that Elemental be installed so that the different versions and build types are cleanly separated.

Thus, two versions of Elemental need to be built.  One is a hybrid release build with OpenMP parallelization, and the other is the pure release build without OpenMP parallelization.  A separate build folder will be created for each build.  The build that uses internal OpenMP parallelization is called a ‘HybridRelease’ build; the build that doesn’t is called a ‘PureRelease’ build.  The debug build is called a ‘PureDebug’ build.  The HybridRelease build is best for large problems, where the problem size is large enough to overcome the OpenMP parallel overhead. The following is for the 0.84 version of elemental. Set the version to that specified in the README.html file. Note that the files will be installed in **/usr/local/elemental/[version]/[build type]**.

**The SmallK software supports the latest stable release of Elemental, version 0.81, 0.83, 0.84, 0.84-p1, and 0.85.**

**A note of caution: copying the command lines from this website and pasting them into a terminal may result in the commands not properly executing due to how characters are interpreted: the double dash --, “double quotes”, etc. For pasting the commands to a terminal, first copy the command lines to a text editor and copy/paste from there.**
<br>[--back to top--](#top)

<h1 id="MacOSX"> How to Install Elemental on MacOSX </h1>

On MacOSX we recommend using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) as the package manager. Homebrew does not require sudo privileges for package installation, unlike other package managers such as MacPorts. Thus the chances of corrupting vital system files are greatly reduced with Homebrew.

It is convenient to be able to view hidden files (like .file) in the MacOSX Finder. To do so run the following at the command line:

	defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES

To hide hidden files, set the Boolean flag to NO:

	defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool NO

If you use Homebrew, ensure that your PATH is configured to search Homebrew’s installation directory first. Homebrew’s default installation location is /usr/local/bin, so that location needs to be first on your path. To check, run this command from a terminal window:

	cat /etc/paths

We also recommend running the following commands on a daily basis to refresh your brewed installations:

	brew update
	brew upgrade
	brew cleanup
	brew doctor

This will maintain your Homebrew installed software and diagnose any issues with the installations.
If the first entry is not /usr/local/bin, you will need to edit this file.  This is a system file, so first create a backup. Move the line /usr/local/bin so that it is on the first line of the file. Save the file, then close the terminal session and start a new terminal session so that the path changes will take effect.
<br>[--back to top--](#top)
<h2 id="mac_GNU"> OSX:Install the latest GNU compilers </h2>
Elemental and SmallK both require a modern C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard.  We recommend that you install the latest stable version of the clang and GNU C++ compilers.  To do this, first install the XCode command line tools with this command:

		xcode-select --install
If this command produces an error, download and install XCode from the AppStore, then repeat the command.  If that should still fail, install the command line tools from the XCode preferences menu.  After the installation completes, run this command from a terminal window:

		clang++ --version
You should see output similar to this:

		Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.51) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
		Target: x86-64-apple-darwin13.4.0
		Thread model: posix

The latest version of the GNU compiler at the time of writing is g++-4.9.1, which is provided by the ‘gcc’ homebrew package. In addition to the gcc package, homebrew also provides a gcc49 package from the homebrew/versions tap. If this alternative gcc49 package is installed on your system it will prevent homebrew from symlinking the gcc package correctly. We recommend uninstalling the gcc49 versioned package and just using the gcc package instead. The Fortran compiler provided with the gcc package will also be configured to properly build numpy, which is required for the python interface to smallk.
If you need to uninstall the gcc49 package, run the following commands:

		brew uninstall gcc49
		brew cleanup
		brew doctor
Then install the gcc package as follows:

		brew install gcc
The Apple-provided gcc and g++ will not be overwritten by this installation. The new compilers will be installed into /usr/local/bin as gcc-4.9, g++-4.9, and gfortran-4.9. The Fortran compiler is needed for the installation of MPI and for building the python interface to smallk.
<br>[--back to top--](#top)
<h2 id="mac_open_mpi"> OSX:Install OpenMPI </h2>
Install the latest version of OpenMPI with Homebrew as follows:

		brew install open-mpi –-c++11

The Homebrew install formula provides an option for “thread-multiple” support, but do not enable this option, as it is still experimental, not optimized for performance, and may have bugs.
<br>[--back to top--](#top)

<h2 id="mac_libflame"> OSX:Install libFlame </h2>
Next we detail the installation of the high performance numerical library libflame. The library can be gotten from the libflame git repository on github.

It’s important to perform the git clone into a subdirectory NOT called ‘flame’ since this can cause name conflicts with the installation. We normally do a git clone into a directory called ‘libflame’. However, other directory names will work as well, but not ‘flame’.

To obtain the latest version of the FLAME library, clone the FLAME git repository with this command:

		git clone https://github.com/flame/libflame.git
Run the configure script in the top-level FLAME folder as follows (assuming the install path is /usr/local/flame):

	./configure –-prefix=/usr/local/flame –-with-cc=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9 –-with-ranlib=/usr/local/bin/gcc-ranlib-4.9
A complete list of configuration options can be obtained by running ./configure –-help.

After the configuration process completes, build the FLAME library as follows:

		make –j4

The –j4 option tells Make to use four processes to perform the build.  This number can be increased if you have a more capable system.

		make install

The FLAME library is now installed.
<br>[--back to top--](#top)
<h2 id="mac_elemental"> OSX:Install Elemental </h2>

###Here is our suggested installation scheme for Elemental:###

Choose a folder for the root of the Elemental installation.  For our systems, this is

		/usr/local/elemental

Download one of the smallk-supported releases of Elemental (see above), unzip and untar the distribution, and cd to the top-level folder of the unzipped distribution.  This folder will be denoted by UNZIP_DIR in the following instructions.
For the first step of the installation, for Elemental versions prior to 0.85, we need to fix a few problems with the CMake configuration files. Open the following file in a text editor:

		UNZIP_DIR/cmake/tests/OpenMP.cmake

On the first line of the file, change

		if(HYBRID)

to this:

		if(ELEM_HYBRID)

Next, open this file in a text editor:

		UNZIP_DIR/cmake/tests/Math.cmake

Near the first line of the file, change

		if(PURE)

to this:

		if(ELEM_PURE)

Save both files.

From the Elemental-0.84-p1 folder, run the following command to create a local build folder for the HybridRelease build:

		mkdir build_hybrid
		cd build_hybrid

Use the following CMake command for the HybridRelease build:

	cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/elemental/0.84-p1/HybridRelease
	-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=HybridRelease 
	-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-4.9 
	-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9 
	-D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.9 
	-D MATH_LIBS="/usr/local/flame/lib/libflame.a;-framework Accelerate" 
	–D ELEM_EXAMPLES=ON –D ELEM_TESTS=ON  ..

Note that we have installed g++-4.9 into /usr/local/bin and libFLAME into /usr/local/flame. Alter these paths, if necessary, to match the installation location on your system.

Once the CMake configuration step completes, you can build Elemental from the generated Makefiles with the following command:

		make –j4

The –j4 option tells Make to use four processes to perform the build. This number can be increased if you have a more capable system.

After the build completes, install elemental as follows:

	make install

As a final step, if you installed a version of Elemental other than one of the 0.84 series releases, edit the file /usr/local/elemental/<version>/HybridRelease/conf/ElemVars and replace the line 

		CXX = /usr/local/bin/g++-4.9

With this:

		CXX = /usr/local/bin/g++-4.9 -std=c++11

This will eliminate some compiler warnings about C++11 constructs.

After this, run these commands to create a build folder for the PureRelease build:

		cd ..

mkdir build_pure

		cd build_pure 

Then repeat the CMake configuration process, this time with the following command for the PureRelease build:

	cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/elemental/0.84-p1/PureRelease 
	-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=PureRelease -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-4.9 
	-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9 
	-D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.9 
	-D MATH_LIBS="/usr/local/flame/lib/libflame.a;-framework Accelerate"  
	–D ELEM_EXAMPLES=ON –D ELEM_TESTS=ON  ..

Repeat the build commands and install this build of Elemental. Then, if you installed a version of Elemental other than one of the 0.84 series releases, edit the /usr/local/elemental/<version>/PureRelease/conf/ElemVars file and replace the CXX line as indicated above.

This completes the two builds of Elemental.To test the installation, follow Elemental’s [test instructions](http://libelemental.org/documentation/0.84/build.html) for the SVD test to verify that Elemental is working correctly.

<h1 id="Linux"> How to Install Elemental on Linux </h1>

We strongly recommend using a package manager for your Linux distribution for installation and configuration of the required dependencies.  We cannot provide specific installation commands for every variant of Linux, so we specify the high-level steps below.

<h2 id="lin_GNU"> Linux:Install the latest GNU compilers </h2>
We recommend installation of the latest stable release of the GNU C++ compiler, which is g++-4.9 at the time of this writing. Also install the latest version of GNU Fortran, which is needed for the installation of MPI. 
<h2 id="lin_open_mpi"> Linux:Install OpenMPI </h2>
Download the latest version of [OpenMPI](http://www.open-mpi.org/), unzip and untar the downloaded zip file, and cd to the untarred directory.  Run configure as follows, all on a single line.  This command assumes that gcc-4.9 has been installed; change the version number if a later version was installed, or if the paths are incorrect for your system:

		./configure --enable-mpi-thread-multiple --prefix=/usr/local CC=/usr/local/bin/
		gcc-4.9 CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-4.9 F77=usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.9 FC=/usr/local/bin/
		gfortran-4.9

Wait for the configure script to finish – this could take several minutes. Then build the code as follows:
		make -j4
Install with:
		make install
OpenMPI provides many tests to verify the installation; it’s a good idea to run at least some of these tests to ensure that MPI was installed successfully.
<br>[--back to top--](#top)
<h2 id="lin_libflame"> Linux:Install libFlame </h2>

Next we detail the installation of the high performance numerical library libflame. The library can be gotten from the libflame git repository on github.

It’s important to perform the git clone into a subdirectory NOT called ‘flame’ since this can cause name conflicts with the installation. We normally do a git clone into a directory called ‘libflame’. However, other directory names will work as well, but not ‘flame’.

To obtain the latest version of the FLAME library, clone the FLAME git repository with this command:

		git clone https://github.com/flame/libflame.git
Run the configure script in the top-level FLAME folder as follows (assuming you want to install to /usr/local/flame; if not, change the prefix path):

		./configure --prefix=/usr/local/flame --with-cc=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9 
			--with-ranlib=/usr/local/bin/gcc-ranlib-4.9
A complete list of configuration options can be obtained by running

		./configure –-help

Then build and install the code as follows:

		make -j4
		make install

This completes the installation of the FLAME library.
<br>[--back to top--](#top)

<h2 id="lin_blas"> Linux:Install an accelerated BLAS library </h2>

It is essential to link Elemental with an accelerated BLAS library for maximum performance. Linking Elemental with a ‘reference’ BLAS implementation will cripple performance, since the reference implementations are designed for correctness not speed. If you do not have an accelerated BLAS on your system, you can download and build OpenBLAS. Download, unzip, and untar the tarball (version 0.2.8 as of this writing) and cd into the top-level folder. Build OpenBLAS with this command, assuming you have a 64-bit system:	make BINARY=64 USE_OPENMP=1Install with this command, assuming the installation directory is /usr/local/openblas/0.2.8/:	make PREFIX=/usr/local/openblas/0.2.8/ installThis completes the installation of OpenBLAS.<br>[--back to top--](#top)

To minimize build problems and overall hassle, we recommend that Elemental be installed so that the different versions and build types are cleanly separated.Here is our recommended installation scheme for Elemental:Choose a folder for the root of the Elemental installation. For our systems, this is

		/usr/local/elemental
	

Download the desired release of [Elemental](http://libelemental.org/releases/) (0.84-pl at this writing), unzip and untar the distribution, and cd to the top-level folder. We will designate the version with a <version> place holder.

Run these commands to create the required directories for the build types:

		mkdir build_hybrid
		mkdir build_pure

###HybridRelease build
From the Elemental-<version> folder, run the following command to create a local build folder for the HybridRelease build:

		mkdir build_hybrid
		cd build_hybrid

For the first step of the installation, we need to fix a few problems with the CMake configuration files. Open the following file in a text editor:

		Elemental-<version>/cmake/tests/OpenMP.cmake

On the first line of the file, change

		if(HYBRID)

to this:

		if(ELEM_HYBRID)

Next, open this file in a text editor:

		Elemental-<version>/cmake/tests/Math.cmake
Near the first line of the file, change

		if(PURE)

to this:

		if(ELEM_PURE)

Save both files.

Run the following command to create a local build folder for the HybridRelease build:

		mkdir build_hybrid
		cd build_hybrid

Use the following CMake command for the HybridRelease build:

	cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/elemental/0.84-p1/HybridRelease
	-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=HybridRelease -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-4.9
	-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9
	-D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.9
	-D MATH_LIBS="/usr/local/flame/lib/libflame.a;-L/usr/local/openblas/0.2.8/ –lopenblas –lm"
	–D ELEM_EXAMPLES=ON –D ELEM_TESTS=ON  ..

Note that we have installed g++-4.9 into /usr/local/bin and libFLAME into /usr/local/flame. Alter these paths, if necessary, to match the installation location on your system.

If this command does not work on your system, you may need to define the BLAS_LIBS and/or GFORTRAN_LIB config options.

Once the CMake configuration step completes, you can build Elemental from the generated Makefiles with the following command:

		make –j4

The –j4 option tells Make to use four processes to perform the build. This number can be increased if you have a more capable system.

After the build completes, install elemental as follows:

		make install

As a final step, if you installed a version of Elemental other than one of the 0.84 series releases, edit the file /usr/local/elemental/<version>/HybridRelease/conf/ElemVars and replace the line

		CXX = /usr/local/bin/g++-4.9

With this:

		CXX = /usr/local/bin/g++-4.9 -std=c++11

This will eliminate some compiler warnings about C++11 constructs.

If you installed Elemental version 0.85, you need to setup your system to find the Elemental shared library.  Either in your startup script (~/.bashrc) or in a terminal window, enter the following command on a single line, replacing VERSION_STRING as above:

		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/elemental/VERSION_STRING/HybridRelease/lib/
<br>[—back to top--](#top)

###PureRelease build
After this, run these commands to create a build folder for the PureRelease build:

		cd ..
		mkdir build_pure
		cd build_pure

Then repeat the CMake configuration process, this time with the following command for the PureRelease build:

	cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/elemental/0.84-p1/PureRelease
	-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=PureRelease -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-4.9
	-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9
	-D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.9
	-D MATH_LIBS="/usr/local/flame/lib/libflame.a;-L/usr/local/openblas/0.2.8/ –lopenblas –lm"
	–D ELEM_EXAMPLES=ON –D ELEM_TESTS=ON  ..

If this command does not work on your system, you may need to define the BLAS_LIBS and/or GFORTRAN_LIB config options.

Repeat the build commands and install this build of Elemental. Then, if you installed a version of Elemental other than one of the 0.84 series releases, edit the /usr/local/elemental/<version>/PureRelease/conf/ElemVars file and replace the CXX line as indicated above.

If you installed Elemental version 0.85, you need to setup your system to find the Elemental shared library for the PureRelease build.  Enter the following command in a terminal window on a single line, replacing VERSION_STRING as above:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/elemental/VERSION_STRING/PureRelease/lib/

Note: you will need to set this variable to point to either the HybridRelease or the PureRelease build of the Elemental shared library whenever you want to use smallk.

This completes the two builds of Elemental.

To test the installation, follow Elemental’s [test instructions](http://libelemental.org/documentation/<version> /build.html) for the SVD test to verify that Elemental is working correctly.

<h1 id="smallk"> Build and Installation of SmallK </h1>

<h2 id="source_code"> Obtain the Source Code </h2>
The source code for the SmallK library can be downloaded from the [SmallK repository](https://github.com/smallk/smallk.github.io/tree/master/code) on github.

Once downloaded uncompress the tar ball and follow the installation instructions below.


<h2 id="build_smallk"> Build the SmallK library </h2>

After downloading and unpacking the code tarball cd into the top-level SmallK directory.  The makefiles assume that you followed our suggested installation plan for Elemental.  If this is not the case you will need to do one of the following:

		1. Create an environment variable called ELEMENTAL_INSTALL_DIR which contains the 
			path to the root folder of your Elemental installation
		2. Define the variable ELEMENTAL_INSTALL_DIR on the make command line
		3. Edit the SmallK makefile so that it can find your Elemental installation
Assuming that the default install locations are acceptable, build the SmallK code by running this command from the root directory of the distribution:

		make all
This will build the SmallK library and several command-line applications. These are:

	1. libsmallk.a, the SmallK library
	2. preprocess_tf, a command-line application for processing and scoring term-frequency matrices
	3. matrixgen, a command-line application for generating random matrices
	4. nmf, a command-line application for NMF
	5. hierclust, a command-line application for fast hierarchical clustering
	6. flatclust, a command-line application for flat clustering via NMF
	7. pysmallk.so, if PYSMALLK=1 (0: default), the Python-wrapped SmallK library, making SmallK available via Python
To install the code, run this command to install to the default location, which is /usr/local/smallk:

		make install
This will install the binary files listed above into the /usr/local/smallk/bin directory, which needs to be on your path to run the executables from anywhere on your system and avoid prepending with the entire path. This will install pysmallk.so into the site-packages directory associated with the Python binary, which is determined by ‘brew install python’ as discussed above. To install the binary code to a different location, either create an environment variable called SMALLK_INSTALL_DIR and set it equal to the desired installation location prior to running the install command, or supply a prefix argument:

		make prefix=/path/to/smallk  install
To install the Python library to a different location, create an environment variable called SITE_PACKAGES_DIR and set it equal to the desired installation location prior to running the install command, or supply this as an argument for make:

		make SITE_PACKAGES_DIR=/path/to/site-packages install

Or, as a last resort, you can edit the top-level SmallK makefile to conform to the installation scheme of your system.  You may need root privileges to do the installation, depending on where you choose to install it.

Before testing the installation, the test code needs to access data. The data is located in a separate github repository so that when cloning the code, the large amount of data is not included. The data repository is located on github at [smallk_data](https://github.com/smallk/smallk_data):

To test the build, run this command with DATA_DIR set to wherever the smallk data repository was cloned:

		make check DATA_DIR=../smallk_data
This will run a series of tests, none of which should report a failure.  Sample output from a run of these tests can be found in section [SmallK Test Results](http://smallk.github.io/documentation/tests/#smalk_tests).

Note: if you installed Elemental version 0.85, you will need to configure your system to find the Elemental shared library.  See the Elemental installation instructions above for information on how to do this.

The command-line applications can be built individually by running the appropriate make command from the top-level smallk folder.  These commands are:

		To build the smallk library only: 		make libsmallk
		To build the preprocessor only:			make preprocessor
		To build the matrix generator only:		make matrixgen
		To build the nmf only:					make nmf
		To build hierclust only:				make hierclust
		To build flatclust only:				make flatclust

This completes the SmallK NMF library installation.

<h1 id="python_install"> Installation of Python libraries </h1>

<h2 id="osx_python"> OSX:Install Python libraries</h2>

###Install Python scientific packages
Assuming that you have used brew to install gcc, as indicated earlier, you can run the following commands to install the necessary libraries:

		brew install python
		brew install numpy
		brew install scipy

To check your installation, run:

		brew test numpy

IMPORTANT: Check to see that your numpy installation has correctly linked to the needed BLAS libraries.

Ensure that you are running the correct python:

		which python

This should print out /usr/local/bin/python. Open a python terminal and run the following:

		import numpy as np
		np.__config__.show()

You should see something similar to the following:

		lapack_opt_info:
		extra_link_args = ['-Wl,-framework', '-Wl,Accelerate']
		extra_compile_args = ['-msse3']
		define_macros = [('NO_ATLAS_INFO', 3)]

		blas_opt_info:
		extra_link_args = ['-Wl,-framework', '-Wl,Accelerate']
		extra_compile_args = ['-msse3', '-I/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Header’]
		define_macros = [('NO_ATLAS_INFO', 3)]

If you are using OpenBLAS, you should see that indicated as well.

###Install Cython: a Python interface to C/C++

First install the Python Package Index utility, pip. Many Python packages are configured to use this package manager, Cython being one.

		brew install pip

To install Cython:

		pip install cython

<br>[—back to top--](#top)
<h2 id="lin_python"> Linux:Install Python libraries</h2>
The Python libraries can easily be installed via pip and apt-get with the following commands:

		pip install numpy
		apt-get install python-scipy
		pip install cython


<h2 id="build_python"> Build pysmallk shared library</h2>
Before building pysmallk, you must ensure that you have already built the standard SmallK library and applications: libsmallk, preprocessor, matrixgen, hierclust, and flatclust.

All C++ and python libraries and applications can be built simultaneously by setting the PYSMALLK command line variable:

		make PYSMALLK=1

To build pysmallk individually:
		
		make pysmallk
		
To check the library installation:

		make pysmallk_check DATA_DIR=../smallk_data
This will run a series of tests, none of which should report a failure.

To install the shared library in a globally accessible location, enable the PYSMALLK command line variable and, if needed, specify an INSTALLATION_DIR.
The Makefile assumes an installation path of /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages for the compiled library file. If you are not using brew to install your packages, you will need to tell the Makefile where the appropriate site-packages directory is located on your system. Setting the INSTALLATION_DIR command line variable when running make accomplishes this. Also, make sure that there is not another site-packages directory in your PATH before the site-packages you intend to use since ‘make install’ will copy pysmallk.so to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages by default. Other Python distributions will probably interfere with the pysmallk installation.
		make install PYSMALLK=1	INSTALLATION_DIR=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
To uninstall the libraries:
		make uninstall PYSMALLK=1	INSTALLATION_DIR=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

<h1 id="matrix_files"> Matrix file formats </h1>

The SmallK software supports comma-separated value (CSV) files for dense matrices and [Matrix Market](http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html) files for sparse matrices.

For example, the 5x3 dense matrix

		42	47	52
		43	48	53
		44	49	54
		45	50	55
		46	51	56

would be stored in a CSV file as follows:
	
		42,47,52
		43,48,53
		44,49,54
		45,50,55
		46,51,56

The matrix is loaded exactly as it appears in the file.  **Internally, SmallK stores dense matrices in column-major order**.  Sparse matrices are stored in **compressed column format**.

Disclaimer
----------

This software is a work in progress.  It will be updated throughout the course of the 
XDATA program with additional algorithms and examples.  The distributed NMF 
factorization routine uses sequential algorithms, but it replaces the matrices and matrix 
operations with distributed versions.  The GA Tech research group is working on proper 
distributed NMF algorithms, and when such algorithms are available they will be added to 
the library.  Thus the performance of the distributed code should be viewed as being the
baseline for our future distributed NMF implementations.
