<a name="intro" class="anchor" href="#intro"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction to SmallK</h2>

<p>SmallK is a high performance software package for low rank matrix approximation via the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF is 
a low-rank approximation where a matrix is approximated 
by a product of two nonnegative factors. 
The role of NMF in data analytics has been as significant as the singular value decomposition (SVD). However, due to 
nonnegativity constraints, NMF has far superior interpretability of its results for many practical problems such as image processing, chemometrics, bioinformatics, topic modeling for text analytics and many more.
Our approach to solving the NMF nonconvex optimization
problem has proven convergence properties and is one of the most efficient 
methods developed to date.</p>

<p>Recently open sourced: MPI-FAUN!

Both MPI and OPENMP implementations for MU, HALS and ANLS/BPP based NMF algorithms are now available. The implementations can run off the shelf or can be easily integrated into other source code. These are very highly tuned NMF algorithms to work on super computers. We have tested this software in NERSC as well OLCF cluster. The openmp implementation is tested on many different linux variants with intel processors. The library works well for both sparse and dense matrices.

<p>
Community discovery is an important task for revealing structures in large
networks. The massive size of contemporary social networks poses a tremendous
challenge to the scalability of traditional graph clustering algorithms and the
evaluation of discovered communities. Our methodology uses a divide-and-conquer
strategy to discover hierarchical community structure, non-overlapping within
each level. Our algorithm is based on the highly efficient Rank-2 Symmetric
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization. We solve several implementation challenges to
boost its efficiency on modern CPU architectures, specifically for very sparse
adjacency matrices that represent a wide range of social networks. Empirical
results have shown that our algorithm has competitive overall efficiency, and
that the non-overlapping communities found by our algorithm recover the ground-
truth communities better than state-of-the-art algorithms for overlapping
community detection.
