SmallK is a high performance software package for low rank matrix approximation via the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Algorithms for NMF compute the low rank factors of a matrix producing 
two nonnegative matrices whose product approximates the original matrix. 
The role of NMF in data analytics has been as significant as the singular value decomposition (SVD). However, due to 
nonnegativty constraints, NMF has far superior interpretability of its results for many practical problems such as image processing, chemometrics, bioinformatics, topic modeling for text analytics and many more.
Our approach to solving the NMF nonconvex optimization
problem has proven convergence properties and is one of the most efficient 
methods developed to date.
