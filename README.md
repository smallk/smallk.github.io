# dblp: computer science bibliography ground truth data for graph analytics

We provide new data sets of the DBLP computer science bibliography network with richer metadata and verifiable ground-truth knowledge, which can foster future research in community finding and interpretation of communities in large networks.

There are six files in total:

	dblp15_graph.mtx The adjacency matrix of the graph
	dblp15_graph_weighted.mtx Weighted adjacency matrix, the weight means how many times two authors have collaborated
	dblp15_ground_truth.mtx ground truth matrix,  where the (i,j) entry equaling 1 means that author i published in venue j
	dblp15_ground_truth_split.mtx split ground truth matrix, where the original ground truth communities are split into connected components
	dblp15_authors.txt list of author names, as appeared in the dblp.xml file, the order of which is consistent with all the matrices
	dblp15_venues.txt list of venue keys, as described in the paper, the order of which is consistent with the matrix in dblp15_ground_truth.mtx

Community discovery is an important task for revealing structures in large networks. The massive size of contemporary social networks poses a tremendous challenge to the scalability of traditional graph clustering algorithms and the evaluation of discovered communities. Our methodology uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to discover hierarchical community structure, non-overlapping within each level. Our algorithm is based on the highly efficient Rank-2 Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization. We solve several implementation challenges to boost its efficiency on modern CPU architectures, specifically for very sparse adjacency matrices that represent a wide range of social networks. Empirical results have shown that our algorithm has competitive overall efficiency, and that the non-overlapping communities found by our algorithm recover the ground-truth communities better than state-of-the-art algorithms for overlapping community detection. These results are part of an upcoming publication cited below.
